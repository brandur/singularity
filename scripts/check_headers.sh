# This project uses a custom Markdown addition that allows headers to be
# annotated with an ID so that we can name their permalink. This looks
# something like this:
#
#     ## The Best Section (#the-best-section)
#
# Unfortunately, these are easy to forget, and when I do, the result is a
# generically-named header. This script checks to make sure that all headers
# have an identifier. It runs in CI.

# That first character class should probably be something like [^\(\n], but for
# the life of me I can't get it to not match newlines, which leads to a huge
# multi-line match (even in single line mode). This sucks because I'll probably
# have to add new characters to the class, but it's mostly okay for now.
